what i want in a relationship

1. willingness to work through disagreements
	- i am stubborn a lot of the time
	- i do want o work through things i get scared because you are so emotive 
		- this is not a bad thing i love this trait in you
	- not to throw in the towel or get down on myself (need to stay positive and believe in us)
	
2. honest communication
	- i think we have started doing better on this 
	- still have to keep it a priority and work on this with you 
	
3. Emotional support
	- i can do better at this; i can't only be there when its right for me. i want to be there for you always
	- empathise with you and not just tell you how it makes me feel

4. Sex and initmacy
	- bestfriends just won't cut it
	- the spark is not gone from me
	- i find you incredibly sexy and love our sexy times 
	
5. Being able to admit mistakes and talk about failures
	- sometimes i just get down on myself because i'm not doing anything interesting rn
	- want to be able to show you i am just human
	
6. Take step out of the box
	- want to be able to do new things with you and share new experiences we haven't done before
	- i think the book club idea will be v fun 
	- discovering new things in general and sharing them with each other
